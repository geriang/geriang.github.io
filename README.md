<b>DWAD19 Project One</b><br>
<b>Project Name : SGxProperty</b>

SGxProperty is a residential property transaction map-based checker, designed specially for home owners and buyers to check for Resale (Secondary Market) HDBs (Housing & Development Board) flats that were transacted in 2022.

With the ever climbing property prices and the burst in property transactions during recent years, it has become important for home sellers to know how much their flat could fetch based on the recent transactions in their neighbourhood.

UX/UI 
This section should:

Share links to wireframes, mockups, diagrams that are used in the UI/UX processes. Those files can be pushed to the Github repository, or be placed in a separate PDF file as part of the repository. 
Describe what your considerations were for the Five Planes of UI/UX, such as the choice of color and fonts for the surface plane, or information organization strategy for the structure plane. 
FEATURES
List down the major features of your application, and also the algorithms that you have used to implement those features. If there are any limitations or bugs, please describe them as well. If you have any features pending implementation, you can also take the opportunity to discuss them here.

USER STORIES
If you wish to present the features list in a form more suitable for software development, you can write them as user stories instead. 
A basic user story consists of: 
 The role, or type of the user
A statement describing what the user wishes to a
A statement describing the intent of the user
Explain what features in your application can meet this particular user story.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

TESTING
Provide proof that you have done testing on your project. You can provide step by step instructions for the examiner to test the project. Use your user stories and their acceptance criteria as a starting point. Do note that any unhandled exceptions, console errors etc will be considered as failing the testing criteria. 
You may want to provide manual test cases. An example of a manual test case could be: 
1. Test that user can sign in 
a. From the home page, click on the 'Login' button 
b. Fill in a valid username and password and click on the 'Login' button c. The user should be redirected to the profile page 
2. Test user entering an invalid password 
a. From the home page, click on the 'Login' button 
b. FIll in a valid username but an invalid password, and click on the 'Login' button c. The user should be informed that the login has failed.



You can consider putting your manual test cases in a PDF file if they make your readme file too long. 
TEST CASES
If you wish to present your testing steps in a clearer method, consider writing test cases. A test case consists of the following structure:


Test Case #
Test Case Description
Test Steps
Expected Result


Prerequisite: The user is at the calculate BMI form

Calculate the BMI 
1) Enter the weight into the textbox as 84kg
2) Enter the height into the textbox as 1.71

The above format is just an example. As long as you provide:

The expected results
Any assumptions or prerequisites

The examiner must be able to follow your test case.
